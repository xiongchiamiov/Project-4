This was a project for John Dalbey's CPE 305.  There is a partial
implementation of a CGI-like framework in Java.  This is all pretty terrible,
but `server.sh` is interesting.

If you are a computing student at Cal Poly who has not yet taken CPE 305, do
not read this.

If you are a non-computing student at Cal Poly who might transfer to a
computing major, do not read this.

If you are a student at another school who might transfer to Cal Poly, do not
read this.

If you are a potential student of Cal Poly, do not read this.
